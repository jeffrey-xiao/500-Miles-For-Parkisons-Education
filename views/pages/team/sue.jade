	h1 Sue Thompson
	
	p Sue was born and raised in Toronto and is also a graduate of Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario where she studied Physical and Health Education and completed a master's degree in Sport Psychology before heading to teacher's college at the University of Toronto. Sue was a member of the rowing team at both Queen's and U of T. Sue has been teaching in Toronto since 1990.
	
	p Facing a physical challenge is not new for Sue, who underwent a successful liver transplant in 1999 and was able to overcome a bout with stage 4 Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma shortly thereafter. Sue feels strongly that her positive mental health and active lifestyle were instrumental in her recovery. Sue and a team of educator's and students have put together the 500 Minutes for Parkinson's Challenge and a website to support schools and youth groups who wish to learn more about Parkinson's disease and to help get them involved in the 500 Miles for Parkinson's Project.
	
	p Sue lives in Toronto with her husband Tom, and three amazing children; Jenn, Christopher and Amanda.
